        <button class="collapsible collapsible1">Software Engineer vs. Software Developer</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the world of software creation, the job titles of software engineer and software developer are often used interchangeably.</p>
            
            <p>However, for IT industry insiders, these roles are not the same. Just like a doctor would not refer to themselves as a physician's assistant, a software engineer would not use the title software developer. </p>
            
            <p>The difference between these two roles lies in the engineering training required, the scope of the job function, and in many cases, the authority level. </p>
            
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible">What‚Äôs a Software Engineer?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The key word in this job title is ‚Äúengineer.‚Äù According to Engineer‚Äôs Edge, ‚Äúengineering is the discipline, art, and profession of acquiring and applying scientific, mathematical, economic, social, and practical knowledge to design and build.‚Äù</p>
            
            <p>Software engineer is responsible for the entire product development life cycle. This means the engineer notices a need (or is given a problem) and designs a holistic solution, including all of its interconnected components. Before starting on their design, they consult with stakeholders and gather project requirements. And after their design has been implemented and the new software deployed, the software engineer will likely give demonstrations, monitor the system, and interview users to further optimize the software experience.  </p>
            
            <p>To develop the technical expertise needed for this kid of work, software engineers either complete at least a bachelor‚Äôs degree in computer science or another engineering discipline.</p>
            
            <h4>Software Engineer Job Description</h4>
            <p>Even in job descriptions, the terms software engineer and software developer are sometimes used interchangeably, but a deeper dive into the job description itself should reveal which of these two roles an organization is actually hiring for.</p>
            
            <p>Here are some of the skills, qualifications, and responsibilities you may find in a software engineering job description. </p>
            
            <h5>Software Engineer Skills and Qualifications </h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Experience creating and maintaining IT architectures and databases</li>
                <li>Problem-solving skills</li>
                <li>Pattern design and experience with cloud-based infrastructure</li>
                <li>Embedded development/debugging experience</li>
                <li>Experience on multi-core CPU or SMP</li>
                <li>Knowledge of multiple programming languages including C/C++</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h5>Responsibilities</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Design, develop, unit-test, and maintain embedded networking software</li>
                <li>Work closely with the QA team in developing test plans</li>
                <li>Liaise with product marketing and customer success teams</li>
                <li>Work across teams to provide technical guidance and support the entire development process of the product</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible">What‚Äôs a Software Developer?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>If a software engineer is the architect, a software developer is the carpenter. They execute plans by programming individual components of the system and ultimately bringing the solution to life.</p>
            
            <p>In general, developers are not responsible for designing the whole system. Instead, they focus only on a single project as part of the whole. To build out a software solution, they rely less on math and science principles and more on informal methods. They do not need to prove the viability of their design with empirical evidence and are given more creative reign in building the software as they see fit.</p>

            <p>Whereas engineers design, liaise, oversee, and head-up the project, software developers are getting their hands dirty writing code to bring the project to life.</p>
            
            <p>Software developers must analyze the software requirements given to them and determine how to build specific functions of the system. They should possess a mastery of at least one front-end or back-end programming language and be familiar with agile development practices and test-driven development. </p>
            
            <p>During the build process, software developers will likely work closely with graphic designers, customer representatives, product managers, senior managers, and decision makers. And because building software is an iterative process with changing requirements, developers must have good communication skills and be receptive to feedback from all these team members (and from users).</p>
            
            <h4>Software Developer Job Description</h4>
            <p>As we‚Äôve discussed, developers usually perform a specific function, such as front-end development or back-end development, within the larger IT system and may specialize in a certain development framework to complete that function. These specialties are reflected in job posts, with companies posting ads for roles like ‚ÄúBack-End Java Developer‚Äù or ‚ÄúFront-End React Developer.‚Äù</p>
            
            <h5>Software Developer Skills and Qualifications </h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Able to write clean, maintainable code</li>
                <li>Expertise in Javascript, ReactJS, AngularJS, jQuery</li>
                <li>Experience building the front end of applications with ES2015+, NodeJS, jQuery, HTML5   , and CSS3</li>
                <li>Experience in front-end tooling and workflows with Git, Grunt/Gulp</li>
                <li>Experience in responsive web design</li>
                <li>Understanding of cross-browser compatibility </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h5>Responsibilities</h5>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Contribute to continual improvements of the UI architecture</li>
                <li>Explore cutting-edge front-end technologies to create new innovative features</li>
                <li>Build tools for improving internal productivity</li>
                <li>Participate in rapid iterative prototyping based on project requirements</li>
                <li>Collaborate with designers, front-end engineers, product managers, and QA engineers to maintain a quality UX</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        
        <button class="collapsible collapsible1">Programmer vs Developer</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Developers are more involved with and have a greater understanding of the full project scope.</p>
            
            <p>Programmers  are involved in a specific part of the project ‚Äî coding.</p>
            <p>A programmer‚Äôs job includes writing code, testing, and fixing bugs.</p>
            <p>A programmer converts a design into instructions that a computer can follow. These instructions are coded using one of many programming languages. They usually know several of these languages including Java, C#, PHP, Oracle, SQL Server, JavaScript, etc.</p>
            
            <h4>Developers (also referred to as software engineers)</h4>
            <p>Their job responsibilities include writing code, but they also contribute to many other aspects of the project/software development process. Along with coding, a developers tasks often include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>software design</li>
                <li>development</li>
                <li>research</li>
                <li>writing documentation and specs</li>
                <li>maintenance</li>
                <li>testing software</li>
                <li>core implementation</li>
                <li>analysis</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Basically, a developer is a programmer first and foremost but with larger scope of responsibility for other aspects of the project.</p>
            
            <p>A programmer and a developer are both involved with coding, but their jobs are very different.</p>
            
            <p>An amazing programmer doesn‚Äôt necessarily make an amazing developer because a developer has to juggle more parts of the project. Many developers start out as programmers and work their way into developer positions if they are interested in taking on greater responsibility.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible collapsible1">Coder vs. Programmer</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>At the most basic level, programming is a broader discipline whereas coding is a narrower one.</p>
            
            <p>All programmers are coders but not all coders are programmers. Some experienced programmers use the word "coder" as jargon that refers to a beginner (junior) software developer.</p>
            
            <p>A programmer is typically responsible for an entire software product whereas a coder is responsible for a certain part or parts of the software product.</p>
            
            <p>Coders typically follow given instructions and requirements to write code whereas programmers often use their own imagination and analytical skills to solve specific problems.</p>
            
            <p>To be a coder, one should know the syntax, but to be a programmer, one should understand and complex data structures and algorithms as well as be able to create such algorithms.</p>
            
            <p>Programmers should be able to come up with abstract solutions to a problem before they even start coding. Besides, they should think proactively and be able to predict as many potential issues as possible. Finally, programmers use code to express their thoughts of how to solve a problem.</p>
            
            <p>Programmers often write or ask technical writers to provide technical specifications ‚Äì documents containing requirements that the final product should meet and problems that it should solve. Coders then follow those specifications to write code, but do not work on specifications themselves. </p>
            
            <p>Programmers are also involved in compiling, debugging, testing, and implementation of the code. In other words, the duties of a programmer can go far beyond coding.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible collapsible1">Back-end vs. Front-end Developer</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>When it comes to developers, there are typically two groups to choose from frontend developers and backend developers.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Frontend developers build how a website looks.</li>
                <li>Backend developers build how a website works</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Let‚Äôs say that you wanted to build a WordPress website for your business. The frontend developer would create the theme: the images, style, and presentation. While the backend developer may work on managing the database, as well as the site‚Äôs users, security, and site performance issues.</p>
            
            <h4>Programming Languages</h4>
            <p>Frontend developers primarily use three languages:  HTML, CSS, Javascript. Over the past few years, the role of the front-end developer has evolved, and so professional frontend devs might also want to consider developing some more intermediate to advanced JavaScript skills, as well as building up experience using command line tools and a framework such as React.</p>
            
            <p>Backend developers need to be proficient in programming languages that render on the server side of a website or application. The most popular backend programming languages are PHP, Ruby, Python, Node.js, and Java. </p>
            
            <p>Backend developers will also need to proficient in working with databases like MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.</p>
            
            <h4>Skills</h4>
            <p>Frontend developers work on the appearance and user-interface of the website, and so in addition to the programming languages listed above, the frontend dev should have some skills using design tools like PhotoShop, Sketch or Figma. Frontend developers should also know the basics of web hosting, and buying a domain.</p>
            
            <p>Backend developers, on the other hand, need to have critical thinking skills. A backend dev is often debugging code, as well as designing systems for how the user will interact with the website.</p>
            
            <h4>Salary</h4>
            <p><b>Frontend:</b> $70,000 USD (average base pay according to Glassdoor.) With a range from $56k to $111k. And an hourly rate of around $50/hour.</p>
            
            <p><b>Backend dev:</b> $117,000 USD (average base pay according to Glassdoor). With a range from $100k to $140k. And an hourly rate of around $65/hour.</p>
