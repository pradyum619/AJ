        <button class="collapsible">What is an IDE?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is an application which facilitates the application development. In general, an IDE is a graphical user interface (GUI)-based workbench. It is designed to help a developer in building software applications with an environment combined with all the required tools at hand.</p>
            
            <p>Selecting a good IDE is based on factors, like language support, needs of the OS and costs associated with using the particular IDE, etc.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible">Advantages of using an IDE</button>
        <div class="content">
            <b>1. Less time and effort:</b> The entire purpose of an IDE is to make the development process much faster and easier. Various tools and features help you organize resources, prevent mistakes, and provide shortcuts.
            <br> <br>
            <b>2. Enforce project or company standards:</b> Simply by working in the same development environment, a group of programmers will bond to a standard way of doing things. Standards can be further enforced if an IDE offers predefined templates, or if the code libraries are shared between different team members/ teams working on the same project.
            <br> <br>
            <b>3. Project management:</b> Many IDEs have documentation tools that either automate the entry of comments by the developer or that may actually make the developers write comments in different areas.

        <button class="collapsible">The Difference Between IDE and Code Editors</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>It might appear that in this age when writing code has become a common enough skill, there is still confusion about the exact definition of an IDE and a code editor. Part of the problem could be traced to the fact that the line between the two is blurring because of crossover of features.</p>
            
            <p>Essentially, an Integrated Development Environment or IDE is a self-contained package that allow you to write, compile, execute and debug code in the same place. On the other hand, a code editor is a text editor with several features that facilitate the process of writing code, either through native capabilities or through optional plugins.</p>
            
            <p>Generally, IDE is focused on a single language and contains the compiler/interpreter and debugger specific to the language. In contrast, code editors are more general purpose in their capabilities, being able to work with a number of programing languages. Code editors are limited to writing code and do not go beyond this stage.</p>
            
            <p>Both IDE and code editors share common features such as code completion, hints, highlighting sections of code and custom folding of sections of code. Choosing between an IDE or code editor is largely a matter of personal preference, the particular programming language and the workflows.</p>
        </div>
