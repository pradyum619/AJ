        <button class="collapsible">Similarities Between Flutter and React Native</button>
        <div class="content">
            <h4>Both Are Designed For Cross Platform App Development</h4>
            <p>React Native and Flutter, both offer superior, rapid, and high-quality app performances on multiple platforms including Android, iOS, and UWP.</p>
            
            <h4>Both Frameworks Are Backed By Giant Tech Communities</h4>
            <p>React Native is offered by Facebook and Flutter is Google‚Äôs open-source SDK for mobile app development. Both have strong developers‚Äô community which is again a common factor between them.</p>
            
            <h4>Open-Source, Free, And Fast</h4>
            <p>React Native and Flutter are open-source and free SDKs that let developers create amazing apps quickly due to their native performances.</p>
            
            <h4>Up-to-Date And Detailed Documentation</h4>
            <p>The communities of both these frameworks are putting extra efforts to keep documentation up-to-date with API references and comprehensive resources.</p>
            
            <h4>Excellent UI Support And Native Experience</h4>
            <p>React Native uses fundamental UI building elements as you use in Android/iOS to deliver the native experience. Flutter also makes use of rich widgets to provide remarkable native experience on Android and iOS platform.</p>
            
            <h4>Hot Reloading And Quick Modifications</h4>
            <p>React Native supports ‚ÄúHot Reloading‚Äù that enables simultaneously running new code and keeping hold of application state, instead of recompiling. This makes development faster, instant, and efficient.</p>
            
            <p>Flutter is not left behind. Introducing ‚ÄúStateful Hot Reloading‚Äù as explained above, Flutter supports immediate reflection of changes without restart or in case of loss of application state.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible">Flutter vs. React Native: Discovering Differences</button>
        <div class="content">
            <h4>The Key Difference of Programming Language</h4>
            <p>Flutter uses Dart.</p>
            <p>React Native lets you develop an app using JavaScript. JavaScript doesn‚Äôt need any introduction. Needless to say, it has received enormous popularity be it a mobile, web, or server-specific code.</p>
            <p>On the other side, Dart is quite new to the developers. It uses modern features of several languages to code beautiful native apps. Again, keep in mind that there isn‚Äôt any JavaScript components and styling. Also, there is no separation of templates, style, and data files. Dart is easy-to-use for the people who have experience developing an app in OOP languages such as C++ and Java.</p>
            
            <h4>Stability And Flexibility</h4>
            <p>In terms of stability, there isn‚Äôt any significant difference as both are managed by well-established tech communities.</p>
            
            <p>Talking about flexibility and customization, Flutter offers a rich set of customized widgets to build attractive experiences. React Native, on the other side, offers seamless user experience via directly communicating with the native platforms.</p>
            
            <p>Flutter is still trying to make its position in the market due to the recent stable release, and React Native is enjoying the first position in the list of cross-platform app development tools in the market.</p>
            
            <h4>Development Time Of An App</h4>
            <p>Leveraging cross-platform, companies already save time that generally occupies in coding apps in multiple languages.</p>
            <p>In addition to that, React Native and Flutter both are committed to providing faster time-to-market of an app. You can use third-party libraries and ready-to-use components to build an app. A customized and high-quality range of widgets helps build an app in lesser time than native app development.</p>
            
            <h4>Performance: Who Wins?</h4>
            <p>Flutter certainly wins over here due to its simplicity.</p>
            <p>However, React Native is popular for delivering excellent user experience on both the platforms.</p>
            <p>Flutter has the extra advantage of reusing the code while React Native is less suitable due to its architecture.</p>
            <p>Flutter also has one more advantage of JavaScript layer that makes communication with the native components easier.</p>
            <p>Both are reliable choices when you choose cross-platform but, Flutter has competitive advantages of its simplicity and Dart platform.</p>
            
            <h4>IDE And Ease of Coding:</h4>
            <p>Flutter is new and supported by Android Studio/IntelliJ, Visual Studio Code at present. As React Native has passed 3 years since its launch, it is supported well by almost all leading IDEs.</p>
            
            <p>React Native offers easy learning curve due to the use of JavaScript. Flutter requires learning Dart to craft an app. However, Dart is a plus point for C++ and Java developers.</p>
