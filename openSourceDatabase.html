        <div class="content">
            <p>Most companies today need some kind of database, but it‚Äôs not always easy to know which one would best fit your needs. They started out as sets of punch cards, but are now monstrous databases capable of storing petabytes of information.</p>
            
            <p>That can make it pretty tough on a new user looking for a database software solution for their business. But there are three database types we see most frequently: <a href="https://www.g2.com/categories/relational-databases?__hstc=171774463.a717ff091c1c197e287a35c6e82b957c.1573381894660.1573381894660.1573384509976.2&__hssc=171774463.1.1573384509976&__hsfp=1166032065" target="_blank">relational databases</a>, <a href="https://www.g2.com/categories/document-databases?__hstc=171774463.a717ff091c1c197e287a35c6e82b957c.1573381894660.1573381894660.1573384509976.2&__hssc=171774463.1.1573384509976&__hsfp=1166032065" target="_blank">document databases</a> and <a href="https://www.g2.com/categories/key-value-stores?__hstc=171774463.a717ff091c1c197e287a35c6e82b957c.1573381894660.1573381894660.1573384509976.2&__hssc=171774463.1.1573384509976&__hsfp=1166032065" target="_blank">graph databases</a>.</p>

        <button class="collapsible collapsible1">Best Free Relational Databases</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Relational databases store and manage data in a traditional table format, with each piece of data organized into a row and a column. Columns hold the data of a single type or field, like first name, order number, or the image link of a product logo. Rows create the relationship between these data points.</p>
            
            <p>For example, rows can associate a first name to a last name and then to a user name, email address, and customer ID.</p>
            
            <p>Businesses use relational databases to maintain the data from their applications and ensure they always have access to critical customer information, product data, social data, and financial particulars like purchases, fulfillment, revenue, and expenses.</p>
            
            <p>Almost all use a form of SQL as their query language, and most adhere to the ACID set of properties to ensure reliable transactions: atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability. </p>
            
            <p>Relational databases are generally chosen due to their simplicity in comparison to NoSQL databases, such as object-oriented databases, document databases, and graph databases. Those looking for a relational database solution with little budget also have options with free database software. </p>
