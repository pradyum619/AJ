           <p>MATLAB is a statistical analysis tool that is used in various industries for Data Analysis. MATLAB is used widely in the Computer Vision and Image processing industry as well.</p>
           
            <h4>Pros:</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Eases developing scientific simulation thanks to a rich inbuilt library</li>
                <li>Functionality can be extended greatly by adding toolboxes</li>
                <li>High coding efficiency and productivity as it doesn’t require a compiler for execution</li>
                <li>Ideal for developing scientific research applications</li>
                <li>Matlab Coder allows converting code for using in other programming languages, such as C++, Java, and Python</li>
                <li>Platform-independent</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Cons:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Not free to use, requires purchasing a license</li>
                <li>Not much application beyond the scope of numerical computing</li>
                <li>Dealing with errors generated during cross-compilation requires extensive knowledge and experience</li>
                <li>Slower due to being an interpreted programming language</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Python and JavaScript are hot in the startup world. Many startups use Django (Python), Flask (Python), and NodeJS (JavaScript) as their backend frameworks. Python and JavaScript are easy-to-learn and therefore considered the best programming languages to learn for beginners. Moreover, both of them also provide a huge market opportunity. Therefore, those who are looking for a job change may also consider learning them.</li>
                <li>Java and PHP are hot in the corporate world. Many organizations use Spring (Java) and Codeigniter (PHP) as their web backend framework.</li>
                <li>R and MATLAB are hot in the Analytics world. If you wish to develop a career in data analytics, these are the languages to learn.</li>
                <li>C/C++ and Golang are the top choices in building low-latency and scalable systems.</li>
