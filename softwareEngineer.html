        <div class="content">
            <p>Software engineering is a branch of computer science which includes the development and building of computer systems software and applications software.</p>
            
            <p>Computer systems software is composed of programs that include computing utilities and operations systems.</p>
            <p>Applications software consists of user-focused programs that include web browsers, database programs, etc. </p>
            
            <p>Software engineers have extensive knowledge of programming languages, software development, and computer operating systems, and they apply engineering principles to software creation.</p>
            
            <p>By applying these engineering principles to every stage of the development process, from requirements analysis to the software process, they can create customized systems for individual clients.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible collapsible1">What does a Software Engineer do?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Software engineers are highly sought after. Developers that live in high demand areas often receive many inquiries a month from recruiters and head hunters. A software engineer applies mathematical analysis and the principles of computer science in order to design and develop computer software. </p>
            
            <p>There are many types of software that a software engineer can develop, such as operating systems, computer games, middleware, business applications and network control systems. Changes in technology and new areas of specialization keeps this profession evolving at a rapid pace.</p>
            
            <p>When working with a client, a software engineer will typically analyze the client's needs, then design, test, and develop the computer software in order to meet those needs. They are experts in computing systems, software structure, and recognizing the limitations of the existing hardware.</p>
            
            <p>The process is complicated and intricate, therefore the use of diagrams, flowcharts, and the creation of algorithms to tell the computer what to do are created. Converting these instructions into a computer language (coding/programming) is usually the responsibility of a computer programmer.</p>
            
            <p>Software engineers must also possess interpersonal skills, and be able to effectively communicate with users in order to train, test, and debug software all the way to the end product. They are often involved from the early stages of software planning right through to the testing, development, training, and support stages.</p>

            <p>Software engineers can work as either employees or as contractors. They typically work in comfortable settings, but it is sometimes a stressful job that involves long hours and tight deadlines.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible collapsible1">What career options are available for a software engineer?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Technology is growing at a rapid pace, and opportunities in software development are growing right along with it. For software engineers with an appetite to develop valuable interpersonal skills, management roles are widely available. Interpersonal skills (or soft skills) include communication, conflict management, empathy, leadership, listening, negotiation, a positive attitude, and being able to work as part of a team.</p>
            
            <p>Individuals who are technically skilled communicators have many options available to them. They can, in time, qualify for a variety of roles, including Senior Engineer, Team Lead, Architect, Manager and can eventually make their way to senior management.</p>
            
            <p>A software engineer's career path could look something like this:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Junior Web Developer</li>
                <li>Software Web Developer, Sr. Software Web Developer</li>
                <li>Lead Software Engineer, Technical Architect</li>
                <li>Development Team Lead, Software Development Manager</li>
                <li>Director, Vice President, Chief Technology Officer</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible">1 - Junior Web Developer</button>
        <div class="content">
           <p>This is a starting or ground-floor position that an individual right out of college or an accelerated course could get with little to no computer programming experience.</p>
           
           <p>One can start applying for job postings as a junior web developer with a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. Any number of online coding schools or in-person programs and dev bootcamps offer classes in these programming languages. </p>
           
           <p>Requirements for a junior web developer include: being able to write simple scripts; having an understanding of the expected application lifecycle; and possessing a basic understanding of database and application services, such as caching and queues.</p>
           
           <p>However, the biggest difference between a junior and senior developer is their level of experience.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible">2 - Software Web Developer, Sr. Software Web Developer</button>
        <div class="content">
           <p>A software web developer, or senior software web developer is someone who has: several years of professional programming experience; can write complex code; possesses a thorough understanding of databases, application services and application lifecycle development; and has become proficient at creating entire applications.</p>
           
           <p>People who don‚Äôt like the idea of management and prefer to stick with writing code can spend many years or even their entire career as a senior web developer. However, this position can also be a great jumping off point to a position as a software engineer or a manager, such as lead software engineer or CTO (chief technical officer) of a startup.</p>
           
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible">3 - Lead Software Engineer, Technical Architect</button>
        <div class="content">
           <p>For someone who wants to take on additional responsibility and more of a challenge, but is not interested in team management, a lead software engineer or architect role may be a great fit. </p>
           
           <p>Lead engineers are looked to for guidance and direction by other engineers and programmers, and the role is seen as a mid-level management position. Lead engineers still write code, but also collaborate with others regarding work flow priorities and implement final decisions. They have years of programming experience, expertise in a specific subject matter, and can think of, plan, and build appropriate software to solve complicated problems.</p>
           
           <p>Architects still write code occasionally as well, however they are mainly responsible for designing complex systems that other web developers will implement. The role of architect is a technical one and not usually a stepping stone to something more - often thought of as the highest position on the technical side of things.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible">4 - Development Team Lead, Software Development Manager</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Management is the next step along the software engineer's career path that can involve different focuses and responsibilities. These can include managing teams of developers, managing large-scale projects, and hiring and firing developers.</p>
            
            <p>Mid-level managers (like lead software engineers) keep track of productivity and workflow in the department and report to a senior manager. A senior manager coordinates the needs of the project leader with the development team, which requires excellent people skills and the ability to resolve conflict effectively.</p>
            
            <p>The senior manager‚Äôs job is also to add or terminate employees to the team whenever necessary which can be a challenge at first, but a powerful leadership skill when mastered.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible">5. Director, Vice President, Chief Technology Officer</button>
        <div class="content">
           <p>Senior management (which can include titles such as director, vice president, or chief technology officer) report to the CEO or to the company's board of directors. They oversee the work of other managers and often have some responsibility towards setting strategic and corporate direction.</p>
           
           <p>Some executive type responsibilities may include setting goals and initiatives, developing long-term strategies, and holding various departments accountable for specific measurable objectives.</p>
           
           <p>Senior managers are also responsible for supervising, hiring, and firing mid-level managers. </p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible">What is the difference between a software engineer and a software developer?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>One of the main differences between software engineering and software development is job function. Software engineering applies engineering principles to create software, therefore software engineers take part in software development by connecting the client‚Äôs needs with technological solutions. They systematically develop processes to provide specific functions by using engineering concepts to develop software.</p>
            
            <p>On the other hand, software developers are responsible for the entire development process and are the driving creative force behind programs. They typically work together with the client to create a conceptual design and then have computer programmers create the programming code needed to run the software. The computer programmers along with the software developers will test and fix problems together and the developers will provide project leadership and technical guidance through each stage of the software development life cycle.</p>
            
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible collapsible1">What does it take to succeed as a software engineer?</button>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Software engineers who know how to work well with others are much more likely to be successful in their careers than lone wolves are. </p>
            
            <p>A software engineer's job is to figure problems out and to produce a great product, not just to write as many amazing lines of code as possible. That means communicating with other engineers, developers, managers, quality control people, customers, etc. and treating them with respect and understanding. The better your relationships are with your team, the better your own work will be.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible">2 - Letting go of the ego</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Not bringing your ego to work with you and staying humble can be difficult at times. No matter how good you think you are at what you do, it's inevitable that you will make mistakes along with some bad decisions.</p>
            
            <p>Accepting constructive criticism from your peers when errors are pointed out and accepting responsibility for your mistakes will make you a much better engineer in the long run.</p>
