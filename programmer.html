        <div class="content">
            <p>Before we start looking at how to become a programmer, I need to make sure that you have a complete understanding of what a computer programmer does. A programmer is someone who writes code that tells a computer or some other device what to do.</p>
            
            <p>In the case of a software developer, they take a concept or design and write the code that tells the computer how to execute this concept.</p>
            
            <p>In the case of someone like a web developer, they take a proposed website design and build it by writing the necessary code.</p>
            
            <p>In most situations, a computer programmer is building or creating something based on someone else’s design parameters. However, some programmers design their programs, so this is always an option if you’re an entrepreneurial kind of person!</p>

        <button class="collapsible">1: Understand Why You Want To Start Programming</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The first and one of the most important steps on how to become a programmer is identifying your reasons for starting. Sit down and have a good hard think about the following questions, as your answers will help you decide exactly what path to take:</p>
            
            <h4>Why do you want to learn programming?</h4>
            <p>This is a very important question that you absolutely must ask yourself before you go any further. Do you want to turn it into a career? Do you have a project or concept that you want to turn into a reality on your own? Or do you simply want to learn how to be a programmer because it’s something that’s ‘cool’ at the moment? Answer honestly, because the language that you choose to learn will depend on your answer to this question. </p>
            
            <h4>What do you hope to do with your new knowledge?</h4>
            <p>Again, you need to identify exactly what you want to do with your new programming knowledge. For example, the courses you need to take and the languages you need to learn if you want to become a software developer or systems engineer will be a lot different from the skills you need to make a few changes to the layout of your blog. </p>
            
            <h4>Are you serious about learning to program? </h4>
            <p>This a very important question to ask. Are you serious about learning how to become a programmer and in getting a job in the field, or is it just a fad? If you are serious, then you need to be able to allocate as much time as possible to learning programming skills so that you can start working ASAP! </p>
            
            <h4>What sort of programming do you want to do?</h4>
            <p>More on this in <b>Step 2</b>, but you need to think closely about what sort of programming you want to do and what field you want to go into. Do you want to become a back-end web developer? A software engineer? Or do you want to work on something like artificial intelligence (AI) or another emerging technology? The answer to this question will help shape the learning pathway that you take, so be honest with yourself.</p>
            
            <p>Once you have answered these questions honestly and recorded your answers, it’s time to move onto step two: choosing what sort of programming you want to do and then we’ll move on to the question on how to become a programmer. </p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible">2: Decide What Field You Want To Go Into</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>There are a variety of different types of programming. When you are figuring out how to learn programming, you need to think very carefully about what field you are planning on looking for work in. Some of the most popular types of programmers include:</p>
            
            <h4>Web developers</h4>
            <p>Web developers can be further separated into front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) developers. Front-end programmers are responsible for writing the code that dictates what a website looks like and how its content is presented. Back-end programmers are required to write web apps and other complicated programs that provide the framework for the website to run on. </p>
            
            <h4>Software programmers</h4>
            
            <p>Software programmers areas you can probably guess – responsible for creating software. They usually take a design or a concept that someone else has come up with and write the code to turn it into a working product. </p>
            
            <h4>Data scientists</h4>
            <p>Data scientists usually work in research or academia, where they use Python almost exclusively to analyze and manipulate scientific data. To become a data scientist it is first most important to know how to become a programmer. These specialists are often researchers in their own right, and they often use code to make their job easier. </p>
            
            <h4>Database Administrator</h4>
            <p>Database administrators have several rolls. They are mainly responsible for taking large amounts of company data and securing, organizing, and analyzing it. If you love statistics and consumer data analysis, you should take a closer look at what a database administrator does.</p>
            
            <h4>Mobile app development</h4>
            <p>As the number of smartphone users grows, the demand for exciting new mobile apps also grows.

            <p>So you want to know how to become a programmer right? Well, here’s a little secret for you: </p>
            
            <i>You have to practice. You have to practice a lot!</i>
            
            <p>That’s right (surprise surprise), the key to becoming a good programmer is practice! Practice writing code from the moment you start learning. Download a code editor in your browser and write your little programs. Share them and ask other people to critique your code. Try and learn something new every single day, and practice until you are completely fluent in all aspects of your chosen languages.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible">5: Start Building A Portfolio Of Work</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>While you are practicing, you need to start building a portfolio. Want to know how to become a computer programmer? Well, one of the keys is having a decent portfolio that you can show to prospective employers.</p>
            
            <p>When you go to apply for a job as an entry-level programmer, remember that there are probably at least a few other people who are applying for the same job. You need to do something that makes you stand out above and ahead of the crowd. A portfolio is a great way to do this.</p>
            
            <p>While you are learning how to become a programmer, save all of the little bits of code that you write. Store them somewhere – a website is a great idea, as you can customize or even build it using your coding knowledge – and make them accessible to potential employers when you’re applying for a job. </p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible">6: Apply For Jobs</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>By now you’re well on the way to learning how to be a good programmer. You have picked a programming field, you have started to learn the skills and programming languages that you will need, and you have started practicing writing your code. You have put together a portfolio that showcases all of your work, and you have (hopefully) crafted a new resume. </p>
            
            <p>You may have guessed it already, but it’s time to start applying for jobs!
