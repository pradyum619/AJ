        <div class="content">
            <p>Ethical hacking is the art of legally penetrating enterprise networks in order to discover potential flaws that hackers might leverage for creating an entry point in a given network. </p>
            
            <p>The target of these ethical hacking endeavors is to find out any exploit before they fall in the hand of harmful attackers and patch them before any attack could take place.</p>
            
            <p>Ethical hackers use a diverse set of hacking programs and programming languages for this purpose.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible">1 - Python</button>
        <div class="content">
           <p>The de-facto language for hacking programming, Python is heralded as the best programming language for hacking – and for good reasons so. Ethical hackers often use this dynamic programming language for scripting their on-demand hacking programs on the go. From testing the integrity of corporate servers to automating most of your hacking programs, Python lets you do almost anything if used the right way.</p>
           
           <h4>Highlights of this hacking coding language</h4>
           
           <ul>

        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible">2 - SQL</button>
        <div class="content">
           <p>SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is one of the most favorite hacking programming language for ethical hackers. This programming language is used to query and fetch information from databases. As most web-based software store valuable information like user credentials in some form of a database, SQL is the best programming language for hacking into corporate databases. Without a complete understanding of SQL, you will not be able to counteract database attacks.</p>
           
           <h4>Highlights of this hacking coding language</h4>
           
           <ul>
                <li>SQL is not a traditional programming language and used for only communicating with databases.</li>
                <li>Black hat hackers use this language to develop hacking programs based on SQL injection.</li>
                <li>SQL is often used by hackers to run unauthorized queries in order to obtain unhashed passwords.</li>
                <li>Popular SQL databases include MySQL, MS SQL, and PostgreSQL.</li>
           </ul>
           
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible">3 - C</button>
        <div class="content">
           <p>The holy grail of modern programming languages, it’s no surprise C is also used extensively in the security industry. The low-level nature of C provides an edge over other languages used for hacking programming when it comes to accessing low-level hardware components such as the RAM. Security professionals mostly use this language when they need to manipulate system hardware and resources on a lower level. C also gives penetration testers the ability to write blazing fast socket programming scripts.</p>
           
           <h4>Highlights of this hacking programming language</h4>
           <ul>

        <button class="collapsible">4 - JavaScript</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Thanks to the recent inception of Node.JS, JavaScript has overtaken PHP’s role of the de-facto language of the web. So, it has become the best programming language for hacking web applications. Security professionals often mimic black hat hacker’s method of writing cross-site scripts in JavaScript. As this hacking coding language can manipulate front-end web components as well as their back-end counterpart, it has become a well sought after language for hacking complex web apps.</p>
            
            <h4>Highlights of this hacking programming language</h4>
            <ul>
                
                <li>It is the de-facto choice for developing cross-site scripting hacking programs.</li>
                <li>JavaScript can manipulate the browser DOM very easily, thus making it a viable solution for building internet worms.</li>

        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible">5 - PHP</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>PHP is an acronym for Hypertext PreProcessor, a dynamic programming language upon which modern-day CMS‘s like WordPress and Drupal are built on. As most of the personal websites you see on the internet is based on these CMSs, in-depth knowledge of PHP is a must for compromising such networks. So, if web hacking is your niche, then we certainly recommend you sharpen your PHP skills.</p>
            
            <h4>Highlights of this hacking programming language</h4>
            <ul>
                
                <li>PHP is used extensively in server-side scripting, so knowledge of this hacking programming language is essential if you want to develop server hacking programs.</li>

        <button class="collapsible">6 - C++</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This is arguably one of the best programming language for hacking corporate software. As most corporate software comes under a proprietary license and often require paid activation, hackers usually need to do some reverse engineering in order to bypass that. C++ provides the low-level of access necessary to analyze the machine code and bypass such activation schemes. So, if you want to crack enterprise software or build proprietary hacking programs yourself, mastering C++ should be your foremost priority.</p>
            
            <h4>Highlights of this hacking programming language</h4>
            <ul>
                
                <li>The object-oriented nature of C++ allows hackers to write fast and efficient modern-day hacking programs.</li>
                <li>C++ is statically typed, meaning you can avoid a lot of trivial bugs right at compile time.</li>
                <li>The ability to access low-level system components makes sure hackers can easily reverse engineer enterprise software with this programming language.</li>
                <li>The high-level polymorphism feature allows programmers to write metamorphic computer viruses with C++.</li>

            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <button class="collapsible">7 - Java</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Java is still the most widely used programming language in the industry. It’ powers many “legacy” as well as modern web servers, like the Apache Tomcat and Spring MVC. Moreover, with the inception of Android, Java code now runs on more than 3 billion mobile devices. So, this language is still relevant despite what many may believe. If you’re looking for the best programming language for hacking into mobile devices, Java is the language for you.</p>
            
            <h4>Highlights of this hacking coding language</h4>

        <button class="collapsible">9 - Perl</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Despite what you may think, Perl codebases still occupy a large portion of corporate tools. Although this hacking programming language has long lost the charm it once had, many old systems still use Perl. As it was the go-to solution for building legacy Unix software, this is still one of the best programming languages for hacking into such old machines. A polyglot hacker will use Perl for crafting different parts of his hacking programs – from building exploits to building payloads and backdoors.</p>.
            
            <h4>Highlights of this hacking coding language</h4>
            <ul>
                
                <li>Perl is still the best available language for manipulating text files on Unix systems.</li>
                <li>The extensible nature of Perl allows hackers to create a wide variety of hacking programs with this language.</li>
